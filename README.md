Beartha is doll that incorporates three functions, move, light, and even sound. There are 2 Arduino UNOs and 1 Arduino MEGA used and it was programmed based on its functions respectively. First, on the base which uses sensor that follows an obstacle with an specific distance. One  also on the body of the doll itself that also has a sensor that made its neck containing a servo to rotate 180Â° and its eye to light. Lastly, it has a creepy sound to make it more attractive. Generally, beartha doll is an output that somehow contain the concept of horror.

Components:

Obstacle-follower car kit
Ultrasonic sensors (3)
Servo
LEDs
Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega
Jumper wires
Batteries
Doll and dress

Functions:
1. Light
2. Movement
3. Sound

Light: 
LEDs are installed behind each eye and will light up if the ultrasonic sensor senses an obstacle. Each pair of eyes only light up if the obstacle is at a speciic distance from the sensor. 

Move: 
She is attached to an "obstacle-follower car" hidden beneath her dress. The car allows Beartha to move and has its own separate ultrasonic sensor. When the sensor detects and obstacle at a very close distance, the car will follow the obstacle making her chase that obstacle or much better and scarier, a person. 

In addition, Beartha's head is connected to a servo that allows her head to turn to her scary side. Her head will only turn if the obstacle is at a specific distance form the sensor. It will turn back to her normal face after a specified amount of time. 

Sound:
Beartha has a speaker hidden beneath her dress and can produce various spooky sounds depending on the distance of the obstacle from the sensor.
